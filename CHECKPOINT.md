# CHECKPOINT

Resume file. Update after every meaningful step and before any likely credit cutoff. A new session reads this first, then CLAUDE.md, SPEC.md, PHASES.md and the README "Decisions".

## Status
- Date: 2026-11-02
- Current phase: Phase 1 (MVP), in progress
- Plan: **approved by the user** (2026-11-02)
- Last completed: Phase 1 tasks 3, 4 and 5 (real built-in puzzle stock, app chess/storage integration, board and puzzle screen), a settings screen with persisted piece styles (including licensed Cburnett artwork), and the placement-test onboarding flow.

## Verification
- Ran `:domain:test :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug` with JDK 21.0.11, Gradle 8.14.3 and Android SDK 35.
- **98 domain tests + 15 app tests passed; 0 failures, errors or skips.**
- `:app:assembleDebug` produced a signed debug APK containing `assets/builtin_puzzles.csv`.
- Room exported `app/schemas/com.chesslock.data.ChessLockDatabase/1.json` without a schema-location warning.
- On the test device: the placement screen renders (progress, rating, side, board, lives), the first puzzle is near the
  starting rating, and injecting `placement_completed=true` routes to the normal puzzle screen. The device's app data
  was reset afterwards so the next launch starts the placement test. UI taps cannot be injected through adb on this
  device, so completing the placement test and tapping the board must be checked manually.

## Environment notes
- Dependencies resolve from Google Maven, Maven Central and JitPack (chesslib).
- The committed built-in set contains 50 real Lichess CC0 puzzles, five in each rating band from 600 through 2600. Every FEN and complete UCI sequence was validated with `python-chess`.
- The generator streams the large Lichess dump while retaining only the best candidates per rating band.
- Pushing needs the Claude GitHub App installed on the repo owner (already done; push works).
- Do NOT invent puzzle data.

## Plan (approved)

### Stack
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Material 3, MVVM / clean architecture.
- Room (puzzles, attempts, usage), DataStore (settings), WorkManager (daily pack, midnight reset), Hilt (DI).
- Chess rules: `bhlangonijr/chesslib` (Apache-2.0). Board is a custom Compose component.
- AdMob rewarded ads + UMP consent. Test IDs in debug only.
- Backend (Phase 3): Firebase Auth + Firestore, append-only attempt log for conflicts.
- Puzzle pipeline (Phase 2): GitHub Action processes the Lichess CC0 dump into rating-bucket files hosted statically.

### Main risks
- App blocking: UsageStats polling vs OEM battery kills; foreground service, boot receiver, WorkManager watchdog, "Protection is not active" status. Avoid AccessibilityService.
- Lichess pipeline: dump too large for in-app, so pre-processed buckets hosted statically.
- Ads: hint granted only in `onUserEarnedReward`, never a free fallback; offline disables Hint.
- Licenses: record every dependency, dataset and piece set in README.

### Phase 1 task order
1. [x] Gradle project, Hilt, `AppConfig`, string resources sk/en, theme.
2. [x] Domain logic + unit tests: ELO, reward, lives/penalties, hints, skip rules, budget + midnight reset.
3. [x] Puzzles: `Puzzle` + Lichess CSV parser, `PuzzleProgress`, chesslib legal moves and mating alternatives, Room stock and solved tracking, DataStore player progress, and the generated 50-puzzle built-in asset.
4. [x] Tap-to-move Compose board with legal targets, last-move highlighting, orientation and promotion picker; puzzle screen with lives, ELO, timer, rewards and both skip paths.
5. [x] Placement test: `PlacementTest` staircase + adaptive `PuzzleSelector` with tests, plus the onboarding UI flow using the built-in stock.
6. [ ] Blocking service, categories, block screen, boot receiver
7. [ ] Onboarding + permissions + protection status
8. [ ] Hints with AdMob test ads
9. [ ] README wrap-up for Phase 1, then STOP and wait for feedback

## Done log
- 2026-11-02: cloned repo, read all docs, wrote checkpoint, plan approved, pushed checkpoint.
- 2026-11-02: added `:domain` (AppConfig, EloCalculator, RewardCalculator, PuzzleSession, SkipPolicy, TimeBudget) with 56 passing tests; Gradle project, wrapper, Android skeleton, README build/decisions/licenses, `scripts/test-domain.sh`.
- 2026-11-02: added Puzzle model, Lichess CSV parser, PuzzleProgress, 23 more tests (79 total), built-in set generator script (tested on synthetic data only).
- 2026-11-02: added PlacementTest (staircase) and PuzzleSelector, 19 more tests (98 total), new AppConfig constants.
- 2026-11-02: generated and validated the 50-puzzle Lichess asset; added bounded-memory generation, Room/DataStore, chesslib adapters, the Compose board and puzzle flow, sk/en resources, and 8 passing app tests. Full debug build verified.
- 2026-11-02: added the settings screen (reachable from the puzzle top bar) with persisted piece styles: Classic, Outline and Letters, each previewed and applied live to the board. 4 new app tests (110 total); debug APK built and installed on the test device.
- 2026-11-02: bundled Cburnett chess artwork as VectorDrawables (BSD-3-Clause, documented in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`) and added it as a fourth selectable style; 3 new app tests (113 total). Verified on the device.
- 2026-11-02: added the placement-test onboarding flow: shared board component, adaptive 10-puzzle run from the built-in stock with no rewards/ELO writes, 3 lives per puzzle, early finish on an empty stock, result screen, and `placement_completed` routing. Build and all 113 tests pass; device routing verified.

## Next step
Continue with Phase 1 task 6: the blocking service, categories, block screen and boot receiver, then onboarding/permissions and AdMob hints in the approved order. Puzzle rewards are currently calculated and displayed but are not yet credited to the blocking budget; connect them when the budget/blocking app layer is implemented. No Hint button is exposed before rewarded ads are implemented.
